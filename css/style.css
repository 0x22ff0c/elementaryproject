/*
CSS Flexbox:
- Flexbox stands for 'flexible box'
- It is a dsiplay type that comes with a range of properties allowing you to arrange items easily.
- It is an alternative to using displays, floats, and other layout properties.

A flexbox element is split into two main parts:
1. Container - it is the parent element in which the display type is active. This is usually in the form of a div.
2. Items - it is the child element/s of the container, and make up the contents of the box.
